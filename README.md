# SpringBoot-App-forBeginner
This project is mostly followed the instruction from spring boot course, but a little changes here and there.
1. This application using spring boot and JSP
2. database as h2 (in memory db)
 In memory db will be cleared once application restarts so added some data in the data.sql to add some rows to db.
To Run:
Get app from repository and run from eclipse as java application.
Username: spring
Password: spring
Then you will see todo list. (if you didnâ€™t see the list, just modify data.sql in project or add todo list from app to that user)
You can update or add more.
